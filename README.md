# Java One 2015 Field Report

This repository contains high-level notes of all notable Java One sessions I attended.

## Day 1

Day 1 was mostly about the Java Keynote, plus a few sessions.

- **Building Nanoservices with Java EE**: Not all that applicable to what we're doing, but there were some interesting notes on cost and reasons for doing Microservices.

## Day 2

- **Docker + Kubernetes**: More introductory than I hoped, but good overview of using Docker in a clustered environment using Google's Kubernetes.

- **Java GC Tuning Confessions**: Deep look at the different GC collectors, what's tunable, and good details on G1 (new collector for Java 8).

- **Groovy + REST**: High-level session on different REST APIs available on Groovy. Everything except for Grails basically.

- **Docker Orchestration for Java**: Talk by Patrick Chanezon from Docker on different available orchestration systems out there for Docker containers.

## Day 3
